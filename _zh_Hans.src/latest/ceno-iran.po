"<strong>Montreal, December 15, 2022</strong> – eQualitie is pleased to "
"announce that its Ceno Browser is fulfilling its mission of assisting "
"thousands in Iran, while also advancing its usefulness in the Russia-Ukraine "
"war. Short for censorship.no, Ceno allows individual mobile users to access "
"and share global web content in spite of Internet censorship tactics and in "
"areas of limited connectivity. In 2022 to date, Ceno has helped tens of "
"thousands in Iran, even while their Internet connections have been thwarted."

"Internet shutdowns are becoming more common in undemocratic countries, "
"intensifying the need for decentralized services and tools such as Ceno. In "
"Iran, since protests started to surge in mid-September, the regime has been "
"particularly aggressive in suppressing communication outside of its intranet "
"infrastructure, the National Information Network. Among other things, the "
"authorities have been blocking websites and social platforms; disabling "
"mobile data; encrypting DNS services; and collapsing networks."

"互联网关闭在不民主的国家变得越来越普遍，这加剧了对 Ceno "
"等去中心化服务和工具的需求。在伊朗，自 9 "
"月中旬抗议活动开始激增以来，该政权一直特别积极地压制其内联网基础设施（国家信"
"息网络）之外的通信。除其他外，当局一直在封锁网站和社交平台;禁用移动数据;加密 "
"DNS 服务;以及使网络崩溃。"

"Ceno has persisted around these ploys, using its robust peer-to-peer "
"backbone, Ouinet, to sidestep every blockage, filter, shutdown and attack. "
"The Ceno team is able to extrapolate from its decentralized network that "
"thousands in Iran are now actively using the browser to bypass the national "
"intranet. Ceno’s usage also continues to grow in other censored countries, "
"such as Russia, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Pakistan, India, Yemen, Bangladesh and "
"Myanmar. Each install expands the network by creating bridges between "
"devices and enabling users to share blocked, filtered and censored web "
"content."

"Ceno 一直围绕着这些策略，利用其强大的点对点骨干 Ouinet "
"来避开每一次阻塞、过滤、关闭和攻击。Ceno "
"团队能够从其去中心化网络中推断出，伊朗有数千人现在正在积极使用浏览器绕过国家"
"内部网。Ceno "
"在其他受审查的国家/地区的使用量也持续增长，例如俄罗斯、阿富汗、乌克兰、巴基斯"
"坦、印度、也门、孟加拉国和缅甸。每个安装都通过在设备之间创建桥梁并使用户能够"
"共享被阻止、过滤和审查的 Web 内容来扩展网络。"
