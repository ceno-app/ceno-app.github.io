"<strong>Montreal, December 15, 2022</strong> – eQualitie is pleased to "
"announce that its Ceno Browser is fulfilling its mission of assisting "
"thousands in Iran, while also advancing its usefulness in the Russia-Ukraine "
"war. Short for censorship.no, Ceno allows individual mobile users to access "
"and share global web content in spite of Internet censorship tactics and in "
"areas of limited connectivity. In 2022 to date, Ceno has helped tens of "
"thousands in Iran, even while their Internet connections have been thwarted."

"Internet shutdowns are becoming more common in undemocratic countries, "
"intensifying the need for decentralized services and tools such as Ceno. In "
"Iran, since protests started to surge in mid-September, the regime has been "
"particularly aggressive in suppressing communication outside of its intranet "
"infrastructure, the National Information Network. Among other things, the "
"authorities have been blocking websites and social platforms; disabling "
"mobile data; encrypting DNS services; and collapsing networks."

"Ceno has persisted around these ploys, using its robust peer-to-peer "
"backbone, Ouinet, to sidestep every blockage, filter, shutdown and attack. "
"The Ceno team is able to extrapolate from its decentralized network that "
"thousands in Iran are now actively using the browser to bypass the national "
"intranet. Ceno’s usage also continues to grow in other censored countries, "
"such as Russia, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Pakistan, India, Yemen, Bangladesh and "
"Myanmar. Each install expands the network by creating bridges between "
"devices and enabling users to share blocked, filtered and censored web "
"content."

"“It is gratifying to watch Ceno in action when it matters,” said Dmitri "
"Vitaliev, founder and director of eQualitie. “Where the people of Iran could "
"not access information freely, they can now rely on Ceno to help them "
"navigate their situation and freely access information that is otherwise "
"censored on the Iranian network.”"

"Toronto-based technology group ASL19 to offer practical responses to online "
