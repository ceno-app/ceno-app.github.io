                <summary> What is Ceno Browser? </summary>
                <p>Ceno is a mobile web browser based on Mozilla Android Components. It is designed for accessing and
                    distributing web content (websites) using a novel approach that relies on BitTorrent – a decentralized
                    file sharing network. Ceno's advantage comes from allowing people to access and share web information in and across regions where connectivity has been
                    interrupted or compromised and ordinary browsers are unable to fetch the content requested by you, the user.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary> How does Ceno work? </summary>
                <p>When a website is accessible from your network (e.g. accessing <i>www.canada.ca</i> from your home
                    internet), Ceno will connect to it like a normal web browser.</p>
                <p>When a website is not accessible due to network filtering or blocking, Ceno will attempt to get the
                    content for you. How Ceno attempts to find content depends on whether you have chosen to use Ceno in
                    <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Personal</strong> mode.</p>
                <p>In <strong>Public</strong> mode, Ceno will look into the BitTorrent network to see if another Ceno user
                    has recently shared the requested page and if so, it will retrieve it from their device and make it available to you. 
                    If the content is not yet available in the Ceno peer-to-peer network, Ceno will contact several Injectors to request that website 
                    and have it delivered to you.</p>
                <p>The content that Ceno retrieves via Ceno network (in Public mode) is stored on your device and made available 
                     for sharing with other Ceno users if they request it.</p>  
                <p>In <strong>Personal</strong> mode, your requests are  encrypted. In this mode, the Injectors route your requests 
                    and the responses from the origin website, but do not connect to the BitTorrent network, do not  attempt to locate 
                    the content on other users’ devices and do not share the content you receive with other users.</p>   
                <p>To ensure that your Ceno client can always contact an Injector, we have also created Bridges. If the
                    Injectors are blocked on your network, the Ceno app will look for available Bridges, who will forward
                    your request to the Injectors. The Ceno network currently features around 6,000 Bridges. Their number is
                    always growing. Learn more.</p>
                <p>Screenshots in our User Guide illustrate how you can know where you received the content from.</p>

                <summary> What are the advantages of using Ceno? </summary>
                <p> Whether you are living in a part of the world that
                    restricts access to content, or in a remote area with limited access to the internet, through its peer
                     to peer network Ceno allows you to access information that may otherwise be unavailable.</p>
                <p>Ceno  is free and open source software.  It does not track your online activities, it does not bombard 
                    you with ads, does not collect your private data and does not sell any data to third parties.  
                    In addition, Ceno also offers these advantages:</p>   
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Familiar usage:</strong> Accessing web content using Ceno Browser feels just like surfing the web 
                            using other browsers,</li>
                        <li><strong>Faster browsing:</strong> Since your Ceno app can retrieve  parts of the same content from different members 
                            of the Ceno network at the same time, the load of delivering the content is distributed among different 
                            devices. This is  useful for users as it offers them faster browsing experience,  but also for web 
                            content publishers as it allows them to avoid resource usage spikes at origin servers.</li>  
                        <li><strong>Cheaper browsing:</strong> Content popular in a particular region tends to get stored on devices  in that region, 
                            even if the origin server is abroad. If you are interested in that content, your client may  get it from 
                            some other client in your region, or devices that are on the same local network . In some countries where 
                            international traffic is more expensive than local (e.g. in the presence of a national intranet), this 
                            can actually save you money.</li>        
                    </ul>

                    network yourself to gain in depth understanding of all its features.</p>

                <summary> What are the risks of using Ceno? </summary>
                <h3>Risks for users</h3>
                <p>Every technology that deals with sensitive use cases has its advantages and risks. In this section we list the main
                     risks for Ceno users.</p>
                <h4>Leaving trace in public BitTorrent network</h4>
                <p> By design, Ceno is
                    using the <a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">public BitTorrent network</a> for much of its routing and data storage needs. Whenever you request
                    or share a piece of content on the BitTorrent network (Public mode) you create a record that associates
                    your IP address with a piece of content that was retrieved from a particular website. </p>
                <p>This is a standard practice for most BitTorrent applications and it is that record that helps other Ceno 
                    users find your device in the Ceno peer-to-peer network on the internet, and know what content your device 
                    is able to share.</p>
                <p>But, if a surveillance organisation is monitoring the network activity, they will also be able to see the 
                     activity that involves your IP address, although they won’t be able to see the details of the content your 
                     have accessed.</p> 
                <h4>Potential higher internet data consumption</h4>           
                <p>Sharing retrieved content with other members of Ceno network  uses some data, so users with metered internet 
                    connection need to monitor the amount of data that the device running their Ceno app consumes. </p>
                <p>In response to these risks, we created a <strong>Personal mode</strong> for Ceno users where the
                    service does not interact with the BitTorrent network. We recommend this mode for users who do not want
                    any record of their activity to appear on BitTorrent, as well for website operations that require
                    authentication (for example, when logging into your social media accounts).</p>
                <h4>Your IP address is visible to the Injectors </h4>
                <p>Injectors can also see requests for content on the network, including the IP address of the user making the 
                    request and the name of the website with the desired content.</p>     
                <p>However, injectors cannot distinguish whether a request came from a Ceno user or a bridge. Thus requests 
                    going to the injector cannot be reliably assigned an originating IP addresses.</p>
                <p>Injectors are run and managed by the Ceno team. We do not keep any personally identifiable data and 
                    we periodically delete all access logs.</p>  
                <h4>Your IP address is visible to Ceno Bridges </h4>  
                <p>To ensure that your Ceno client can always contact an Injector, we have also created Bridges. If the 
                    Injectors are blocked on your network, the Ceno app will look for available Bridges, who will forward your 
                    request to the Injectors. The Ceno network currently features around 6,000 Bridges. Their number is always 
                    growing.</p>   
                <p>The purpose of bridges is to act as a ‘middle-man’ between the Ceno app on user’s devices and injectors.  
                    All communication that flows through Bridges is encrypted,  and bridges do not have the private keys required 
                    to access the content of the communication. Bridges need to know your IP address so they can forward your 
                    requests to injectors and forward the responses they get back to you.</p> 
                <h3 id="bridgemode">Risks for Bridge operators</h3>  
                <p>Since any user can become a Bridge, do consider the risks that are introduced by this action.</p> 
                <p>Bridge activity is invisible to the Bridge operator (unless they are actively monitoring their device for incoming 
                    and outgoing connections). Their job is to receive network requests from other Ceno users for access to an 
                    Injector and forward this request.</p> 
                <p>Bridge operators will have their device’s IP address listed in the BitTorrent network as an accessible Bridge.</p>
                <p>Bridging only works when the network that you are in allows for incoming connections. This is checked 
                    automatically by the Ceno app upon start. Most wireless mobile carriers do not allow for incoming connections.</p>

                <summary> Who develops Ceno Browser? </summary>
                <p>Ceno is a technology created and maintained by the Canadian not-for-profit organization <a href="https://equalitie.org">eQualitie</a>. They have incorporated their <a href="https://ouinet.work">Ouinet network library</a> into the Firefox Android browser.</p>
                <p>eQualitie has been in existence for twelve years, during which time they have been creating and advancing
                    tools to protect freedom of speech, facilitate information exchange, and promote self-expression on the
                    internet.</p>
                <p>Some of their other projects include <a href="https://ouisync.net">Ouisync</a>, a service for
                    decentralized file sharing; <a href="https://deflect.ca">Deflect</a>, a tool for DDoS protection;
                    Baskerville, a machine learning-based attack detection system; and the dComms deployment toolkit for
                    setting up decentralized and federated network services.</p>

                <summary> What's the difference between using a VPN and Ceno Browser? </summary>
                <p>VPNs were initially created for private communications between your device and a destination server. As
                    Internet censorship became a frequent occurrence around the world, VPN providers began to offer their
                    services in order to bypass local network restrictions as well. Today, there are numerous VPN providers
                    offering a wide variety of connectivity options to help their users get around local network censorship.
                </p>
                <p>VPNs can see who their clients are and what websites they are requesting. This is by design and a level
                    of trust in the VPN operator is required (much like the trust that is required in eQualitie, who
                    operates the Ceno Injectors). </p>
                <p>Ceno's primary distinction from a VPN is that it does attempt to route all of your website requests
                    through the decentralized network. When a website is available without restriction, Ceno will simply
                    connect to it like a normal web browser. Also, Ceno users cache and share content with each other. This
                    reduces the strain on censorship circumvention nodes and improves deliverability. </p>

            <details>
                <summary> What's the difference between using the Tor and Ceno browsers? </summary>
                <p>Unlike Tor Browser, Ceno Browser is not a tool for anonymity, which is Tor's primary purpose. In the Tor
                    network, network traffic is encrypted and routed through a network of relays run by volunteers, and
                    appears to originate from the IP address of an exit node. Tor is an excellent option for privacy from
                    Internet surveillance and website operators. If it works in your network environment, we recommend it,
                    provided that you've also read <a href="https://support.torproject.org/">their support
                        documentation</a>.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary> Whats the difference between Personal and Public tabs, again? </summary>
                <p>Public tabs use all connectivity methods available in the Ceno network to get the content you want. When
                    browsing using a Public tab you will leave a record of your activity on the public BitTorrent network
                    (your IP address and website you requested). Content that has been retrieved by your device inside a
                    Public tab will be shared with other Ceno users via the BitTorrent network.</p>
                <p>Information requested and retrieved in a Personal tab is not shared with anyone else. No trace of your
                    activity is recorded on BitTorrent. Use Personal tabs for logging into social media and other accounts.
                    Also use them if you do not want to be associated on BitTorrent with any of your browsing activity in
                    Ceno.</p>
            </details>

                <summary> When will there be an iPhone or Windows version? </summary>
                <p>Development of Ceno Browser for iOS and Windows is currently ongoing, with plans for release in early 2025.</p>
