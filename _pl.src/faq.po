"Ceno is a mobile web browser based on Mozilla Android Components. It is "
"designed for accessing and distributing web content (websites) using a novel "
"approach that relies on BitTorrent – a decentralized file sharing network. "
"Ceno’s advantage comes from side-stepping current Internet censorship "
"methods and allowing people to access and share web information in and "
"across regions where connectivity has been interrupted or compromised."

"In <strong>Public</strong> mode, Ceno will look into the BitTorrent network "

"Our motto is ‘Share the Web!’ and essentially that is what Ceno users are "

"this."

"Ceno’s advantage is evident in a network that censors websites, or where the "
"network is weak or unstable. In these circumstances, the Ceno client is able "
"to leverage additional methods to retrieve content and deliver it to your "
"device. By allowing users to enable sharing of content they have recently "
"retrieved, Ceno expands access to the internet more generally. Whether you "
"are living in a part of the world that restricts access to content, or in a "
"remote area with limited access to the internet, Ceno allows you to access "

"Every technology that deals with sensitive use cases has its advantages and "

"VPNs were initially created for private communications between your device "

"other. This reduces the strain on censorship circumvention nodes and "
